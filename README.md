WHAT I DO: Search a folder you target for jpegs, and either copy those jpegs & folders to the location ths program is run from, -OR- work directly in the target folder. Then I Downsize the large ones and apply basic compression to all of them. 

When run, this program, will ask you a couple questions on how to handle your images.  All inputs are either "y" or "n" except for the target address that you are searching for images.  

Create new files Locally: It may not be possible to directly edit, save and delete the file from the server. It may also be faster to do the conversion locally, compare and delete, then push back the compressed copy. That is also the safest. There is an option to automatically copy back all created files. This does not interfere with deletion in any way. 

Delete on the fly: 
  If Working locally:
      Choose "Y": This only applies to the source used for the downscaling. If you have to create the compressed files on your computer first, it will not touch the Originals: only the newly created copy. 
  If working in the server directory without making a local copy first: 
      THIS WILL DELETE THE ORIGINAL without further prompting after the compressed file is made. please test that files are reliably made remotely BEFORE attempting deletion on the fly. There is a check that the new copressed file exists in place before deletion, but.... scary
      

Comparison delete: 
  Only active while working locally. Adding in safety, this gets the list of jpegs again from the remote target and if there is a matching compressed file, it is deleted. If working entirely remotely, Double check is automatic. This is better. 

THIS IS MY DISCLAIMER:
Typically this kind of task is run locally for a bit of redundancy and safety.
Commercial use is a-ok. suggested donations are an am4 mobo with 4 DIMM slots AND/OR or two PCIe x16 slots OR cheap monitors.
